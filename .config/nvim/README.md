Add:
Quick highlight when yanking
Smart/smooth scrolling, and minimum lines shown at top and bottom

Also, decide best way of using [Esc] alternate: jj, jk, kj, ctrl+[, ctrl+j (?)
Ctrl+c can prevent normal funcionality in vim. Ctrl+[ works but causes pinky strain.
Will try typing the '[' with ring finger and see if this helps.
Having unique keybindings in vim does not transfer to unconfigured machines.
Change the timing for 'jj' and the like. Otherwise vim pauses.
